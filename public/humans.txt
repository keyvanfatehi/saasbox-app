We don't need to know how to install an engine into a chassis in order to drive our cars.

Why should software be any different? It shouldn't be -- but it is.

How come with software we actually need to know how to install it in order to start using it?

This is easy enough on Windows or Mac, but gets progressively harder, with web apps being the worst.

Why is maintaining and backing up one piece of software so different from another? Web apps use different databases and require different upgrade and backup strategies.

These problems can be solved through a common platform--they just take experience, time and automation.

Thank you!
