* make sure Strider 1.6.0 is working
  - spin up a new strider, it will use that image
  - install redis, make a supervisor config for it, commit, tag and click "reconfigure"
  - did redis stay? did it startup automatically?
  - if so, commit and push from tux

* on new instance create CONFIGURE screen
  - put a note saying "you can change any of these values later!"

* ydm#apply throws a stupid error
  - wrk01.upstreamapp.com worker.js:  [error] Cannot read property 'login' of undefined 
  - get rid of that above error
  - sometimes we get a socket hangup that trickles to the UI, can we stop that shit

* i broke email
  - maybe switch it back to no-reply?

* setup catchall email address

* switch from help scout to tender (there's a nice app and shit)

* show stats on the frontend
