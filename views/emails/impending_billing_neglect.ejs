Hello <%= username %>,

It looks like we've been having billing issues with your account.

Your account is currently in good standing but in <%= daysLeft %> more day(s) your account will be in bad standing unless we can resolve the issues.

Once your account is in bad standing, all <%= instanceCount %> of your instances may be deleted at any time.

To preserve your good standing, please go to <%= accountURL %> and update your billing information.

If you feel this email has been sent in error, you need some more time, or want some help exporting your data prior to instance removal, email us at support@<%= zone %> as soon as possible.

Thank you!
