Hello <%= username %>,

It looks like we've been having billing issues with your account.

Your account is currently in good standing but in <%= daysLeft %> your account will be marked as being in bad standing.

Once your account is in bad standing, all <%= instanceCount %> instances you have with us will be deleted.

To preserve your good standing, please go to <%= accountURL %> and update your billing information.

If you feel this email has been sent in error, you need some more time, or want help export your data prior to instance removal, email us at support@<%= zone %> within <%= daysLeft %> and we'll be happy to work with you!
